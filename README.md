# Matplotlib Scipy 2018 Tutorial
Matplotlib is a Python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms. Matplotlib can be used in Python scripts, the Python and IPython shells, the Jupyter notebook, web application servers, and four graphical user interface toolkits.

This tutorial aims to unpack some of the fundamental concepts that underlie the architecture of Matplotlib. Using these concepts, attendees will learn how to change the "look and feel" of plots.

This tutorial is inspired by and steals liberally from [Benjamin Root](https://github.com/WeatherGod)'s fantastic [Anatomy of Matplotlib](https://github.com/matplotlib/AnatomyOfMatplotlib) tutorial. It also borrows some things from Rachel Rakov & Hannah Aizenman's [Introduction to Machine Learning with Sklearn](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/machine-learning). 

The authors are also grateful to Michael Grossberg for his liberal feedback and heatmap data set suggestion, Sadie Bartholomew for inspiring a coding challenge with her gorgeous [tweet](https://twitter.com/sadie_lb/status/1145385648532205568), and tutoral participant Dershan Luo for the install check bug fix. :)
