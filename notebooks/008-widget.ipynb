    "In addition to the static figures we have been working with, Matplotlib can produce interactive figures.  For use on a desktop there are bindings to produces figures using the Tk, Gtk, Wx, and Qt frameworks.   These can be used as stand-alone windows are embedded in large applications, see [the gallery](https://matplotlib.org/gallery/#embedding-matplotlib-in-graphical-user-interfaces) for details.\n",

    "You should now have an interactive figure that you can pan / zoom around on just like on the desktop.  Matplotlib is using a client-server model for the display, user input is sent from the Jupyter front-end back to Matplotlib running in your kernel and the kernel ships the rendered png to the browser.  This has he advantages that the plots will look identical to using `inline` or the desktop backends and we do not need to ship all of your data to the browser.  However, this approach has will have higher latency than an in-browser plotting library (such as bokeh or plotly)."
